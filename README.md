## What I Did

- **Organized File Structure**: I implemented a clear and logical file and folder structure for easy navigation and maintenance.
- **Clean and Readable Code**: The HTML and CSS code is written to be straightforward and easy to follow.
- **Fundamental HTML & CSS**: I utilized core HTML elements and basic CSS properties, focusing on the foundational concepts taught in the course.
- **Image Optimization Attempt**: I made efforts to compress the images used in the project. *(Note: The total image size is approximately 8 MB.)*
- **Atomic Commits**: I focused on making small, frequent commits for nearly every change, keeping the commit history clean and understandable.
